								Francophonie or La Francophonie is an international organization representing countries and regions where French is the Mother Tongue or customary language. The term francophonie also refers to the global community of French - speaking peoples. Being a part of Francophonie organization need not the degree of French usage in the member countires, but a prevalent presence of French culture and language, usually steaming from France Colonial ambitions with other nations in its history.<br><br>

								In 1970, its modern organization, held it motto "egalite, complementarite, solidarite" (equality, complementarity, solidarity, a deliberate allusion to France's motto. The Francophonie evolved into global organization embracing and cooperating with its members in the field of culture, science, economy, justice, and peace.
								<br><br>
								With this, the School along with the mission of Department of Education in upholding quality education, aims:<br>
								1.	develop students' skills in listening, reading, writing, speaking and viewing as fundamental to acquiring communicative competence in a second foreign language;<br>
