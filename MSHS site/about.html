						<h1>History</h1>
						<img src="img/old.png" style="width:50%; float: left;">
						<p>The school was founded in 1996, with Carmencita Denampo as supervisor for the high school and elementary department, and was named the Minglanilla Science and Technology School, which is shortened to SciTech. People still use this moniker in reference to the school. Under Denampo's reign, it was renamed Minglanilla School of the Future.<br><br>
In 1998, when Denampo was promoted, Rosita Sanico took over. In her time the high school and elementary department were separated. It was renamed Minglanilla National Science High School.<br><br>
From an enrollment of 31 high school students in 1996, the MSHS has a student population of 413 (as of school year 2014-15); from a one-section school, the MSHS now has a minimum of two for each year level; from a beginning of one-classroom setting on the premises of the Minglanilla Central School, the MSHS now has 14 classrooms, one computer laboratory, and a campus.</p>

"FIRST THINGS FIRST"<br><br>
        I grew up in a family that taught me to excel in everything I do because excellence would lead to success. This is why as a student, as an employee in the Department of Education, and now as a principal of this prestigious institution, excellence and success has always been in my heart. Albert E.N. Gray spent his life searching for the one trait all successful people share. His essay entitled "The Common Denominator of Success" revealed successful people's common characteristic was not hard work, skill, or great human relations, although these traits were important. The one factor that seemed to rise above all the rest was the habit of putting first things first. The Book of Haggai, the second shortest in the Old Testament, communicates this same message: First Things First. It was written to people like us, who would say that God must be first. But they had drifted away from this truth. They lived with misguided priorities. Haggai was sent to help God's people get their priorities in line with what they knew they should be. Few Practical Steps about Putting First Things First. Let me discuss it with you…<br></p>
        <p style=" width:100%;">
1.	Stop Making Excuses. Billy Sunday defined an excuse as "the skin of a reason stuffed with a lie." Benjamin Franklin wrote, "I never knew a man who was good at making excuses who was good at anything else." It is always easy to make excuses when you don't want to obey your parents, your teachers. And you know what? We can always find rational justification for not doing what they want us to do: The time is not right. I've got homework responsibilities. My group activity is as stressing as washing my laundry. My classmates and friend have a week end outing, the list could long. Sometimes our excuse is so good that we can almost convince our parents and teachers that we're right and they're wrong. <br>
2.	Cease being Selfish. Closely aligned with excuse making is a selfish mindset that extends throughout everything. If we give no thought to how we are living, we will naturally live for ourselves. Remember, we are not only created for our own, we are here in this institution to share our knowledge, talents, kills, for the improvement of our school.<br>
3.	Take Time to Evaluate. Evaluation is a good thing. That is why teachers give tests and employers hold job reviews. Socrates wrote: "The unexamined life is not worth living." Each day we need to evaluate how we spend our time and our money, and how we use our talents. We should examine who we choose as friends, what we set as goals, and where we are going.<br><br>

       The failure to make constant corrections each day is like a pilot who does not make slight course adjustments in flight. The plane will end up hundreds of miles off course later or worse it will crash. The failure to take the proper precautions TODAY will result in severe consequences TOMORROW.<br><br>An instructor at a time-management seminar told the participants to prepare for a quiz. He reached under the table and took out a wide-mouthed gallon jar and set it on the table. Next to the jar were a number of fist-sized rocks. He asked the group, "How many of these rocks do you think we can get inside this jar?" The participants made their guesses. The instructor said, "Let's find out." One by one he began to put as many fist-sized rocks as he could into the jar until the rocks inside were level with the top of the jar. The instructor then asked, "Is the jar full?" All the participants looked at the jar filled with rocks and said it was. But then he reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. Then he dumped some gravel in and shook the jar. The gravel filled the spaces between the big rocks. He grinned and asked again, "Is the jar full?" The participants were not about to be fooled a second time. They said that the jar was probably not full. The instructor nodded and said, "Good. You are catching on." He next took out a bucket of sand and poured it into the jar. Slowly the sand filled the gaps between the rocks and gravel. After the sand settled, the instructor once again asked, "Now, is the jar full?" The audience roared, "No!" He said, "Good." He was pleased that they understood an important principle. The instructor poured a pitcher of water into the jar. At this point he stopped and asked the group, "What's the point of this?" Page 5 of 6 Somebody said, "Well, there are always gaps, and if you work at it, you can always fit more into your life." But the instructor said, "No, the point is this: If I hadn't put in those big rocks first, I would never have gotten them in at all." What should be your big rocks? Put them into your life first.</p><img src="img/sird2.png" style="width: 100%;
